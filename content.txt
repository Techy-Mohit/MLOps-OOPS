1. Class and Object(examples)
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. why python is called OOP? - everything in python is an object (data structure , data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
5. End to End project (chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute class as well

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method

6. Inheritance
    > Inheritance code example
    > why inheritance is needed ? (code reuseability,parent has no access to child class)
    > whats gets inherited? - Constructor, Non private attributes, Non private methods
    > constructor overloading & method overloading
    > Super Keyword(can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attributes , used only inside child class)
    > Types of inheritance
        1. Single Inheritance
        2. Multilevel
        3. Hierarchical
        4. Multiple <Diamond Problem>
        5. Hybrid
