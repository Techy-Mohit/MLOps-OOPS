1. Class and Object(examples)
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. why python is called OOP? - everything in python is an object (data structure , data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
5. End to End project (chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute class as well

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method

    > inheritance
